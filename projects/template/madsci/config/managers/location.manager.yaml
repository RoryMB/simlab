# Location Manager Configuration
# ------------------------------
# This file defines physical locations in your lab and how each robot
# reaches them (via joint positions or coordinates).
#
# Customize this file for your project:
# - Define locations relevant to your lab layout
# - Each location has "representations" mapping robot names to joint positions
# - Locations are referenced by name in workflow.yaml files
#
# The transfer_capabilities section defines which robots can transfer
# items between locations.

# Workcell Configuration
# ----------------------
# This file defines which robot nodes are available in this project's workcell.
# Each node entry maps a logical name to the node's REST API URL.
#
# Customize this file for your project:
# - Add/remove nodes based on which robots your project uses
# - Node names should match what you use in workflow.yaml files
# - URLs point to the robot node REST servers (run_node_*.sh scripts)
